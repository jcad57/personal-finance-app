<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A personal finance dashboard that allows users to track their spending, view upcoming bills, set budgets and create savings goals. This was an exciting challenge to work on because it was my first large project I got to build out on my own from front-to-back. It tested my architecture skills as well as problem solving abilities. Some of my favorite features I implemented were all the reusable components (cards, buttons, drop downs, modals, etc.), user login/signup which was a bonus feature to the challenge, and the query/sorting feature using URL params. These were all new challenges for me and it was very rewarding to overcome them. While this may not be the ultimate or more efficient solution to this challenge it still taught me so much which is why I'm so proud to have completed this challenge.
